# Things that I found will help accelerating the learning process
1.  Use PyCharm as Developmet environment
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Kubernetes plugin for PyCharm gives a better intellij.
2. Create a virtual switch for minikube
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I got issues of minikube showing IP of `127.0.0.1` which conflicted with my machine's IP and minikube IP, when using default docker driver.
3. Provide static IP for minikube
